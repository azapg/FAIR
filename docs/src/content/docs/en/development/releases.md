# Release Automation

This project ships with a lightweight release pipeline that runs whenever a Git tag that starts with `v` is pushed to GitHub. The workflow lives in [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](https://github.com/azapg/FAIR/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) and takes care of version metadata, build validation, release creation, and optional package publication.

## Tag-driven Version Management

1. Create a conventional semantic version tag such as `v0.5.0` and push it to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin v0.5.0
   ```

2. The release workflow normalises the tag (for example `v0.5.0` → `0.5.0`) and runs `scripts/sync_version.py` to write that value into `pyproject.toml` and `src/fair_platform/__init__.py` before any build steps execute. The script can also be run locally if you ever need to verify or pre-populate version metadata:
   ```bash
   python scripts/sync_version.py --version v0.5.0
   ```

3. Version changes only exist within the workflow run; they are not committed back to the repository. The effective package version therefore always matches the tag that triggered the release, and developers are free to choose how they manage version bumps on long-lived branches.

## Build and Release Flow

When a tag push kicks off the workflow it performs the following actions:

1. Install the toolchain (Python 3.12, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and [Bun](https://bun.sh/))
2. Install locked frontend dependencies (`bun install --frozen-lockfile`)
3. Execute the project build pipeline via `./build.sh`. This step performs the Bun/Vite frontend build, copies the assets into the Python package, and runs `uv build` to produce artifacts in `dist/`
4. Publish a GitHub release with automatically generated notes and attach all build artifacts from `dist/`. Release notes are generated by GitHub and group commits by type (features, fixes, documentation, etc.) based on the merged PR titles and commit messages since the previous tag
5. Mark the release as a prerelease when the tag contains a hyphen (for example `v0.6.0-rc1`). Plain semantic version tags such as `v1.0.0` are treated as production releases

## Publishing to PyPI

PyPI publication is opt-in. Set the `PYPI_API_TOKEN` repository secret to enable it. The workflow only attempts to publish when **both** of the following conditions are true:

- The tag has no hyphen (e.g. `v1.2.3`)
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` is defined

Packages are uploaded from the `dist/` directory using [`pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`](https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish). For pre-release tags or when the secret is absent, the workflow skips the PyPI step but still produces the GitHub release and attached assets.

If you need to publish to TestPyPI instead, add a similar step with its own secret (for example `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN`) and point it at the alternate repository URL. The existing step is a good template.

## Local Dry Runs

You can rehearse the release process locally to ensure the build succeeds before pushing a tag:

```bash
python scripts/sync_version.py --version 0.0.0-dev
./build.sh
```

The script keeps version numbers aligned, while `./build.sh` reproduces the same sequence of frontend and packaging steps that the workflow runs in CI. Clean the repository afterwards if you do not want to keep the temporary version change.
