# FAIR Documentation

Welcome to the FAIR platform documentation. This site explains how to install,

introductory guides, deployment notes, and developer references.

## What is FAIR?

integrating external learning tools through a plugin system. The project bundles
an API backend, a single-page frontend, and a CLI to help instructors and
contributors build great learning experiences.
